                Mount Fuji (富士山 Fujisan), located on Honshū, is the highest mountain in
                Japan at 3,776.24 m (12,389 ft), 2nd-highest peak of an island (volcanic) in Asia,
                and 7th-highest peak of an island in the world.
                It is a dormant stratovolcano that last erupted in 1707–1708. Mount Fuji lies about 100
                kilometers (60 mi) south-west of Tokyo, and can be seen from there on a clear day.
                Mount Fuji's exceptionally symmetrical cone, which is snow-capped for about 5 months a year,
                is a well-known symbol of Japan and it is frequently depicted
                in art and photographs, as well as visited by sightseers and climbers.

                Mount Fuji is one of Japan's "Three Holy Mountains" (三霊山 Sanreizan) along with Mount Tate and Mount
                Haku. It is also a Special Place of Scenic Beauty and one of Japan's Historic Sites.
                It was added to the World Heritage List as a Cultural Site on June 22, 2013.
                However, the inscription became controversial after two professors at the Mt. Fuji
                World Heritage Centre, Shizuoka were forced to quit their jobs due to academic and racial
                harassment by officials of Shizuoka prefecture government in March 2018 and comments
                on social media called for the cancellation of Mt. Fuji's World Heritage inscription.

                According to UNESCO, Mount Fuji has "inspired artists and poets and been the object
                of pilgrimage for centuries". UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of cultural interest within
                the Mount Fuji locality. These 25 locations include the mountain and the shrine,
                Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha, as well as the Taisekiji Head Temple founded in
                1290, later immortalized by Japanese ukiyo-e artist Katsushika Hokusai.
